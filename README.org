#+TITLE: Transaction Management Using Narayana In Ruby
#+AUTHOR: Samim Pezeshki

* Introduction
This application is a demo for using JBoss Narayana as transaction manager in Ruby
via REST API (rts Subsystem).
There are two transaction types implemented, nested and chained.
The whole environment and application is packaged into Docker containers.
* Requirements
- docker
- docker-compose

* Installing and Running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ docker-compose up
#+END_SRC

The first time, this may take a long time as we need to download Ruby base image, PostgreSQL and Wildfly application server and
build the application. Descriptions about each Docker container is available at =docker-compose.yml= file.

* Description
Narayana transaction manager is a part of Wildfly application server and can be used via its REST API When =rts=
subsystem is enabled in Wildfly. Documentation about how =rts= API works is available at [[http://narayana.io/docs/project/index.html#d0e15500]].

There were no implementation of Narayana API in Ruby so I created it. Communication 
with Wildfly is done through =narayana/transaction= class. It can create a new transaction,
enlist new participants and put or retrieve transaction status.

Here is a sample code of how to use =Transaction= class.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
tx = Transaction.new # Asks for a new transaction on Wildfly
tx.participate @resource  # Enlists resource in transction
tx.commit # Puts new status to Wildfly fot this transaction
#+END_SRC

I created a /Task/ model using =DataMapper= ORM, and created the /Task/ resource using =Sinatra= to respond to
API calls from Wildfly server according to Narayana documentation. Each task can be a type of /Chained/ or /Nested/.
Chained tasks can have one /Next/ task. When a chained task is commited, its next task is
triggered,
Nested tasks can have multiple /SubTasks/. Each nested task is not commited until all of its subtasks are commited.

Using this Task model, we can test our transaction manager. Here is sample code.

Chained transactions

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
t1 = Task.create type: :Chained
t2 = Task.create type: :Chained

# Creating chains
t1.next = t2
t1.save

t1.commit
#+END_SRC

Nested transactions

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
t1 = Task.create type: :Nested
t2 = Task.create type: :Nested
t3 = Task.create type: :Nested, fails: true

# Creating nested
t1.subtasks << t2
t1.subtasks << t3
t1.save

t1.commit
#+END_SRC

Two sample scenarios are tested as client in the =client.rb= file, one chained transaction and one nested.
These scenarios are run in a separate process called =client=. Also we have another process called =service= which
is our server API talking to Narayana on Wildfly server. All interactions are logged to console. A sample log
file is provided with the source code. Here is an example log. The full log output is available at =sample.log=.

The first column says that logs are from the Ruby container. The second column shows
the name of the process. 

* Technical Details
The whole application is in Ruby programming language. It uses =Sinatra= and =Rack= for serving the API.
It uses =DataMapper= as ORM for creating the model. =PostgreSQL= is used as our database for storing tasks.

The processes are described in the file =Procfile= and are managed by =foreman= to run as daemons. 
Eache line in the =Procfile= describes one process of the application.

* Docker Images
The application uses four docker images, postgres, wildfly-rts, dnsdock and ruby. 
The Ruby image is the main image
for our application which is built by the provided =Dockerfile=. These images are in the public Docker hub registry
and are downloaded and built automatically by the above command on the first time. The image dnsdock is used a dns server
between containers so that they can find eachother.

These images are configured and run using =docker-compose=. The configuration is in the =docker-compose.yml= file.
